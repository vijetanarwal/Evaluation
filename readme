# Jenkins Node.js Project Setup

## **Objective**  
Set up a Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy a Node.js application.

## **Tasks**  
1. **Create a GitHub repository** for the Node.js project and push the code.  
2. **Configure Jenkins** to install the required tools.  
3. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job** to automate the process.  
4. **Define a `Jenkinsfile`** that includes the following stages:  
   - Clone the repository using Git.  
   - Install dependencies using:  

     sh 'npm install'

   - Run tests with:  

     sh 'npm test || echo "No tests defined"'

   - Build the application using the command:  

     sh 'npm run build'  

5. **Execute the pipeline** in Jenkins and ensure all stages run successfully.  
6. **Push the `Jenkinsfile`** to the repository.

## **Evaluation Criteria**  
- Correct pipeline syntax and structure.  
- Proper tool configuration in Jenkins.  
- Successful execution of all stages.  
- Implementation of the appropriate build command.

Complete the setup and run the pipeline in Jenkins. Good luck!
